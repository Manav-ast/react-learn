      <h1>Chai</h1>
      <p>Chai is an assertion library for Node.js and browsers that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.</p>
      <p>It provides a BDD/TDD assertion style, allowing you to write tests in a more readable and expressive way.</p>
      <p>Chai has several interfaces, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Assert</strong>: A traditional assert style interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Expect</strong>: A BDD style interface that allows for more natural language assertions.</li>
        <li><strong>Should</strong>: An extension of the Object prototype that allows for a more natural language style of assertions.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
